# Neuro AI Toolbox

This repository is a cross-modal toolbox for machine learning in computational neuroscience, offering quick, copy-ready workflows for DWI, EEG, and fMRI analysis. Each module provides streamlined notebooks and utility scripts for preprocessing, feature extraction, connectivity analysis, and model development. The structure enables researchers to explore methods efficiently, reuse templates, and build complete pipelines with minimal effort.

**Modules included:**

* **DWI:** signal exploration, tract-based feature engineering, and ML-ready extraction pipelines.
* **EEG:** full source reconstruction tutorials and a wPLI connectivity framework that generates frequency-specific connectivity features.
* **fMRI:** classical machine-learning and deep-learning examples using SVMs, MLPs, and transformers.

Use this repository as a compact reference library to accelerate experimental design, compare analytical strategies, and extend workflows for your own datasets.
